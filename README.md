# UPInspect

> Decode. Verify. Pay Safely.

A privacy-first UPI QR code inspector and payment link generator.  
Runs 100% locally in the browser — no server, no tracking, no data collection.

## What It Does

Most UPI QR scans blindly redirect you to a payment app with no chance to verify the details. UPInspect adds a transparent step in between:

**Scan → Inspect → Choose → Pay**

- **Decode & Inspect** — Extract and view the UPI ID, merchant name, and requested amount from any QR code before paying
- **Scan or Upload** — Use your device camera for live scanning, or upload a saved QR screenshot from your gallery
- **Torch Toggle** — Built-in torch control for scanning in low-light environments (on supported devices)
- **Flexible Payments** — Tap "Pay Now" to open your preferred UPI app, or copy the UPI ID for manual high-value transfers
- **Editable Amount** — Modify the pre-filled amount on scanned QR codes before paying
- **Create & Share** — Generate custom UPI payment links and professional QR standee cards
- **Shareable Links** — Every standee share includes a tappable payment link so recipients can pay without scanning
- **100% On-Device** — Your scanned codes and payment data never leave your browser

## Multi-Language Support

UPInspect supports English and Hindi with a modular locale system. Adding a new language takes 3 steps:

**1. Create the locale file**

```
js/locales/mr.js   ← copy en.js, translate all values, keep all keys identical
```

**2. Register it in `js/i18n.js`**

```js
import mr from './locales/mr.js';

const LOCALES = { en, hi, mr };       // add to registry
const CYCLE   = ['en', 'hi', 'mr'];   // add to toggle cycle
```

**3. Done.** The toggle button cycles through all languages automatically.

### How translations work

| Mechanism | Usage |
|---|---|
| `id` matching | `<span id="txtNavHome">` — updated by key lookup |
| `data-i18n` | `<span data-i18n="txtOptional">` — for nested text nodes |
| `data-i18n-placeholder` | `<input data-i18n-placeholder="txtLabelUpiId">` |
| `data-i18n-label` | `<label data-i18n-label="txtLabelName">` — updates text node only, preserves child elements |

In JS files, always use `t('key')` for translated strings — never hardcode `state.currentLang === 'en' ? ... : ...` ternaries. Language state lives in `i18n.js` only, accessed via `getLang()`.

## Payment Link URLs

UPInspect uses clean path-based URLs for shareable payment links:

```
https://upinspect.pages.dev/{upi-id}/{name}/{amount}

# Examples
https://upinspect.pages.dev/rahul@upi/Rahul%20Traders/500
https://upinspect.pages.dev/shop@okaxis/My%20Shop
https://upinspect.pages.dev/pay@upi/500
```

| Segment | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `upi-id` | ✅ | UPI ID (e.g. `name@upi`) — `@` is kept readable |
| `name` | Optional | Merchant or payee name |
| `amount` | Optional | Pre-filled amount in ₹ (numeric segment auto-detected) |

The router auto-detects whether the second segment is a name or an amount, so both `/pa/500` and `/pa/name/500` resolve correctly.

When opened, the link shows a verified payment card with **Pay Now** and **Copy UPI ID** options. No app install required.

---

## Security

- **URI injection blocked** — `Number()` (not `parseFloat()`) is used to parse amounts. `Number('100&pa=attacker@upi')` returns `NaN` and is rejected.
- **Encoding** — UPI ID and amount are wrapped in `encodeURIComponent()` before being placed in any URI or QR string.
- **Amount validation** — Amounts below ₹1 are silently omitted from QR codes and payment links.
- **No network requests** — All QR decoding, generation, and image export happen entirely on-device.

---

## Running Locally

Because the JS uses ES modules (`type="module"`), you need a local HTTP server — opening `index.html` as a `file://` URL will cause CORS errors on module imports.

```bash
# Python (built-in)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node
npx serve .

# VS Code
# Install "Live Server" extension → click "Go Live"
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. Connect it to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
3. Set build command to **none**, output directory to **`/`** (repo root)
4. The `_redirects` file handles SPA routing using explicit path-depth patterns:

```
/:seg1             /index.html  200
/:seg1/:seg2       /index.html  200
/:seg1/:seg2/:seg3 /index.html  200
```

> Using named segments instead of `/*` avoids Cloudflare's infinite-loop detection warning.

## Third-Party Libraries

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [html5-qrcode](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode) | latest | Camera QR scanning |
| [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR) | 1.4.0 | File upload QR decoding (cross-browser, including Firefox) |
| [qr-code-styling](https://github.com/kozakdenys/qr-code-styling) | 1.5.0 | Styled QR code canvas rendering |

> **Note on image export:** The standee save/share flow uses native canvas compositing — not html2canvas. The card is drawn directly onto a `<canvas>` using the exact colours and layout from `views.css`, then the QR is composited via `ctx.drawImage()` reading the full 1200×1200 source pixels directly. This produces a crisp, pixel-perfect 3× PNG with no font re-rasterisation and no blur.

> **Note on file upload scanning:** `html5-qrcode`'s `scanFile()` uses `createImageBitmap()` internally, which behaves inconsistently in Firefox. File uploads are decoded using jsQR directly via `canvas.getImageData()` — this works identically across all browsers.

## Browser Support

| Feature | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Samsung Internet |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QR Camera Scan | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| File Upload Scan | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Torch Toggle | ✅ | ✅ * | ✅ * | ✅ |
| Inverted QR (dark mode) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Save Image | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Share with Image | ✅ | ❌ † | ✅ | ✅ |
| PWA Install | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OS Theme Detection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

\* Torch support depends on device hardware capability, not just the browser.  
† Firefox Android does not support file sharing via the Web Share API. Tapping Share downloads the image and opens a text share sheet with the payment link included in the caption.
